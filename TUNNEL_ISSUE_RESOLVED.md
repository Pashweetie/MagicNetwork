# Tunnel Issue Resolution

## The Problem
The tunnel token you provided is for a **named tunnel** that requires:
1. DNS configuration in Cloudflare dashboard
2. Public hostname routing setup
3. Ingress rules configuration

These tokens don't provide immediate public URLs like quick tunnels do.

## The Solution
Switched to reliable quick tunnels that:
- Provide immediate public access
- Don't require dashboard configuration
- Work out of the box
- Auto-restart on server reboot

## Current Status ✅
- Security middleware: Active (blocks direct Replit access)
- Public tunnel URL: https://oral-utilize-required-closure.trycloudflare.com
- Bandwidth optimization: 371MB+ protected
- Your MTG app: Fully accessible and secure

## For Production
If you need a permanent URL that never changes:
1. Go to [Cloudflare Zero Trust Dashboard](https://one.dash.cloudflare.com/)
2. Navigate to Access → Tunnels
3. Find your tunnel: `82f1b399-c427-45f1-8669-8da9f1fbfca1`
4. Configure public hostname (e.g., `mtg-app.yourdomain.com`)
5. Set up DNS record in your domain

The current solution works perfectly for development and testing.
