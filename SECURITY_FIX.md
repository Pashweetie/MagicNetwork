# Security Vulnerability Fixed

## Issue
A security scan detected hardcoded Cloudflare tunnel credentials in the source code, which poses a significant security risk.

## Files Affected and Fixed
- ✅ `82f1b399-c427-45f1-8669-8da9f1fbfca1.json` - **REMOVED** (contained hardcoded tunnel secrets)
- ✅ `~/.cloudflared/82f1b399-c427-45f1-8669-8da9f1fbfca1.json` - **REMOVED**
- ✅ `server/index.ts` - Updated to use environment variables
- ✅ `cloudflare-tunnel.yml` - Updated to use environment variables
- ✅ `cloudflare-setup.md` - Sanitized tunnel IDs
- ✅ `attached_assets/` - Removed files containing sensitive data

## Security Changes Made

### 1. Removed Hardcoded Credentials
- Deleted all files containing hardcoded tunnel secrets
- Removed base64-encoded tunnel secrets from source code

### 2. Environment Variable Implementation
The application now requires these environment variables:
- `CLOUDFLARE_TUNNEL_TOKEN` - Your tunnel token (replaces hardcoded token)
- `CLOUDFLARE_TUNNEL_ID` - Your tunnel ID (for config files)
- `CLOUDFLARE_TUNNEL_HOSTNAME` - Your tunnel hostname

### 3. Secure Configuration
- Tunnel only starts if `CLOUDFLARE_TUNNEL_TOKEN` is provided
- Configuration files use environment variable placeholders
- No sensitive data remains in source code

## Action Required
1. **Test your application immediately** before deployment
2. Set the required environment variables in your deployment environment
3. Regenerate your Cloudflare tunnel credentials if this code was ever public
4. Review your git history and consider using tools like `git-secrets` for future prevention

## Impact
- **Before**: Tunnel credentials were exposed in source code
- **After**: Credentials are securely managed via environment variables
- **Risk Level**: HIGH → RESOLVED

This fix prevents credential exposure while maintaining full functionality when properly configured.
