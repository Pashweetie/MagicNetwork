# Cloudflare Proxy Setup for Your Replit App

## What Cloudflare Proxy Does

**Free Tier Benefits:**
- **Advanced Caching**: Intelligent cache with custom rules
- **DDoS Protection**: Much stronger than Replit's basic protection
- **Bot Protection**: Blocks malicious crawlers and bots
- **Global CDN**: 200+ edge locations worldwide
- **SSL/TLS**: Enhanced security certificates
- **Analytics**: Detailed traffic and security insights
- **Rate Limiting**: 10,000 requests/month (more than your current app-level limiting)

**Your Current App Stats:**
- 371.3 MB bandwidth saved through image caching
- 100% cache hit rate on card images
- This will be dramatically improved with Cloudflare's edge caching

## Method 1: Use Existing Domain (Easiest)

If you have any domain:

1. **Add Site to Cloudflare**
   - Go to https://dash.cloudflare.com
   - Click "Add a Site"
   - Enter your domain
   - Choose Free plan

2. **Change Nameservers**
   - Cloudflare will show you 2 nameservers
   - Go to your domain registrar (GoDaddy, Namecheap, etc.)
   - Replace existing nameservers with Cloudflare's

3. **Add DNS Record**
   ```
   Type: CNAME
   Name: @ (for root domain) or mtg (for subdomain)
   Target: workspace.pashweetie.replit.app
   Proxy Status: Proxied (orange cloud ☁️)
   ```

Your app will be available at: `https://yourdomain.com` or `https://mtg.yourdomain.com`

## Method 2: Buy New Domain (Best for Production)

1. **Buy Domain** (~$10-15/year)
   - Namecheap, GoDaddy, or any registrar
   - Suggestion: `mtgdeckbuilder.com`, `cardforge.app`, etc.

2. **Follow Method 1 steps**

## Method 3: Cloudflare Workers (Advanced/Free)

Use Cloudflare Workers to proxy without owning a domain:

1. **Create Worker**
   ```javascript
   export default {
     async fetch(request) {
       const url = new URL(request.url);
       url.hostname = 'workspace.pashweetie.replit.app';
       
       const response = await fetch(url.toString(), {
         headers: request.headers,
         method: request.method,
         body: request.body
       });
       
       return response;
     }
   }
   ```

2. **Deploy Worker**
   - Get URL like: `https://your-worker.your-subdomain.workers.dev`

## Cloudflare Configuration for Your MTG App

### 1. SSL/TLS Settings
```
SSL/TLS Mode: Full (Strict)
Always Use HTTPS: On
HSTS: Enable with 6 months max-age
```

### 2. Caching Rules (Free)
```
Rule 1 - Static Assets (Cache Everything for 1 year):
- If URI Path matches: *.js, *.css, *.png, *.jpg, *.jpeg, *.gif, *.ico, *.svg, *.woff*
- Then: Cache Level = Cache Everything, Browser TTL = 1 year

Rule 2 - Card Images (Cache Everything for 1 month):
- If URI contains: /cards.scryfall.io/
- Then: Cache Level = Cache Everything, Edge TTL = 1 month

Rule 3 - API Card Data (Cache with short TTL):
- If URI Path matches: /api/cards/*
- Then: Cache Level = Cache Everything, Edge TTL = 1 hour

Rule 4 - Search Results (Short cache):
- If URI Path matches: /api/cards/search*
- Then: Cache Level = Cache Everything, Edge TTL = 5 minutes

Rule 5 - User Data (No cache):
- If URI Path matches: /api/user/*
- Then: Cache Level = Bypass
```

### 3. Security Rules
```
Bot Fight Mode: On
Challenge Passage: 15 minutes
Security Level: Medium

Rate Limiting:
- /api/* = 100 requests/10 minutes per IP
- /api/cards/search* = 30 requests/10 minutes per IP
```

### 4. Speed Optimizations
```
Auto Minify: CSS, JavaScript, HTML = On
Brotli Compression: On
Early Hints: On (if available)
```

## Performance Impact

**Before Cloudflare:**
- Server handles all requests
- Limited to Replit's single region
- Your app-level caching: 371MB saved

**After Cloudflare:**
- Edge caching worldwide
- Estimated 80-90% traffic offloaded from your server
- Potential 10x improvement in global load times
- Enhanced image optimization

## Setup Priority

For your current needs, I recommend:

1. **Immediate**: Keep current Replit deployment (already optimized)
2. **Week 1**: Set up Method 1 or 2 if you have/want a domain
3. **Future**: Add Method 3 if you want to experiment with Workers

Your app is already production-ready on Replit. Cloudflare proxy is an enhancement, not a requirement.

Would you like me to help you implement any of these methods?
